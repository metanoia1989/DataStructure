# Learn DS & Algorithms

A computer program is a collection of instructions to perform a specific task. For this, a computer program may need to store data, retrieve data, and perform computations on the data.

A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.

Our DSA tutorial will guide you to learn different types of data structures and algorithms and their implementations in Python, C, C++, and Java.
