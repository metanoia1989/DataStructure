# What is B-Tree
A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that is commonly used in databases, file systems, and operating systems to store and manage large amounts of data efficiently. It is called a B-Tree because the name was coined by Bayer and McCreight in 1972.

A B-Tree has several key features:

1. It is a multi-way tree, meaning that each node can have multiple children, unlike binary trees where each node can have at most two children.

2. The number of children a node can have is limited by a parameter called the order of the B-Tree. This parameter determines the maximum and minimum number of keys a node can contain.

3. The keys in a B-Tree are stored in a sorted order, which makes searching, insertion, and deletion operations very efficient.

4. The B-Tree is self-balancing, meaning that the tree structure is maintained even as new keys are inserted or deleted. This helps to ensure that the height of the tree remains small, which in turn helps to keep the search time for a given key logarithmic.

5. B-Trees are widely used in databases because they allow for fast search operations, even on large datasets that cannot fit in memory. They are also used in file systems because they allow for efficient access to large files by keeping the index of the file stored in the tree structure.

Overall, B-Trees are an important data structure for computer science and have been widely adopted in many areas because of their efficiency and versatility.
