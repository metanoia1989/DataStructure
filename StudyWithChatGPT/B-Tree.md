# What is B-Tree
A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that is commonly used in databases, file systems, and operating systems to store and manage large amounts of data efficiently. It is called a B-Tree because the name was coined by Bayer and McCreight in 1972.

A B-Tree has several key features:

1. It is a multi-way tree, meaning that each node can have multiple children, unlike binary trees where each node can have at most two children.

2. The number of children a node can have is limited by a parameter called the order of the B-Tree. This parameter determines the maximum and minimum number of keys a node can contain.

3. The keys in a B-Tree are stored in a sorted order, which makes searching, insertion, and deletion operations very efficient.

4. The B-Tree is self-balancing, meaning that the tree structure is maintained even as new keys are inserted or deleted. This helps to ensure that the height of the tree remains small, which in turn helps to keep the search time for a given key logarithmic.

5. B-Trees are widely used in databases because they allow for fast search operations, even on large datasets that cannot fit in memory. They are also used in file systems because they allow for efficient access to large files by keeping the index of the file stored in the tree structure.

Overall, B-Trees are an important data structure for computer science and have been widely adopted in many areas because of their efficiency and versatility.


# B-Tree mathematical conditions

In B-tree data structure, each node has the following mathematical conditions:

the nodes in a B-tree of order t can have a maximum of t children

1. All keys in a node are sorted in increasing order.

2. The number of keys in a node should be between t-1 and 2t-1 where t is the minimum degree of the B-tree.

3. The number of children of a non-leaf node should be equal to the number of keys in the node plus 1.

4. All leaf nodes are at the same level 

5. A non-leaf node with k keys has k + 1 children.

6. The root node may have less than t-1 keys but must have at least one key and one child.

7. All nodes except the root node must have at least t-1 keys.

These conditions ensure that the B-tree remains balanced and allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.


# order of the tree (minimum degree)

The minimum degree of a B-tree is a parameter that determines the minimum number of keys that a node can have. It is usually denoted by the letter t and is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.

The minimum degree of a B-tree affects the structure of the tree and determines the maximum number of keys that can be stored in a node. For example, if the minimum degree of a B-tree is 3, then a node in the tree can have at least 3 keys and at most 2 * 3 - 1 = 5 keys.

The minimum degree of a B-tree also determines the minimum number of children that a non-leaf node must have. For a non-leaf node with k keys, it must have k + 1 children.

Having a higher minimum degree results in a shallower tree with fewer levels, which can lead to faster search times. On the other hand, having a lower minimum degree results in a deeper tree with more levels, which can lead to slower search times but more efficient storage utilization.
